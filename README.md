### Built with

- React javascript
- CSS custom properties and dynamically rendered css classes
- Flexbox and grid

## My process

- I went through the mobile and desktop styles on the css files
- Created the layout of the components
- Gave the page life with the magic of javascript.

### What I learnt

1. React:
- Function to get data from local storage
- State as an object and using function to handle multiple state changes to avoid repetition.
- Update
- Using date as unique id - can also use math random and external e.g nanoid
  
  Overall it was a very wonderful project.
